## Overview
This repository serves as a starting point for beginners in machine learning and deep learning. It includes simple and well-commented examples to help you understand the core concepts and algorithms. The repository covers:

- Basic machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees)
- Fundamental deep learning models (e.g., neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks)
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
  ## Installation
To run the codes in this repository, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AMevans12/Machine-Learning.git
    cd Machine-Learning
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
You can run the scripts directly from the command line or explore the examples in the Jupyter notebooks. Here are a few examples:

- To run the linear regression example:
    ```sh
    python ml/linear_regression.py
    ```

- To open the machine learning examples notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/ml_examples.ipynb
    ```
